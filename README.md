# news_app

A new Flutter project.

This is a news app made by Aditya Agarwal.
This app includes four screens viz: A Splash Screen, SignIn Screen, Home Screen(displays list of latest news) and Article Page(displays information about particular news).

The "Read More" button in the Article Page redirects to original page of that news in web browser.

Firebase for Google Sign In Authentication

External dependencies used:
    http: ^0.13.4 // REST API services
  firebase_auth: ^3.3.3 // firebase services

Note: Due to large response time of News API, The App will most probably smoothly run in debug mode from source code in IDE(Visual Studio Code). If someone wants the live demo of the App, please consider contacting me at +916386870873, adityaagarwal977@gmail.com
